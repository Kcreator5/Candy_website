        •	Why will people come to your site?
      </h3>
      <p>
        If this was a legitimate site then people would probably come for the innovations in business, such as making/customizing your own candies. This is the case because there is no other business out there, that I know of, that allows it’s customers to make their own candies. The closest thing to this is websites that allow its customers to plaster a logo on pre-made candies. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        •	What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        What candies can I make? What flavors are available? Do they have chocolates?  What type of sweets do they have? Can I submit my own design? Can I buy this in bulk or singles? Can I design my own and sell it to other people? 
      </p>

      <p>•	What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        Browsing selection, creating concepts, and buying candies.  Shipping, 
        
        •	What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
        Prices, ingredients, calories, allergies, quantity, flavors, Size, shelf-life, deals, designs, and how to storage the food. 
        
        •	Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
